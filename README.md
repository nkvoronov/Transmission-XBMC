Transmission Control Panel
=================

A client for the popular [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/) BitTorrent application for [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/)

This repository is a rework of original [Transmission-XBMC](https://github.com/correl/Transmission-XBMC) addon by Correl J. Roush for Kodi 19.0 "Matrix".

Since version 19.0 "Matrix", the Python 2 support will be dropped and only Python 3 addons will be supported.

Also, the original addon featured the 'Search Torrent' functionality using pirate sites. This violates the rules of official Kodl respository, so this addon has only 'Add Torrent File' functionality.

Features
--------

Currently, Transmission Control Panel supports viewing, adding, removing, starting and stopping torrents. More advanced features may be added in future releases.

Installation and Configuration
------------

This script is intended for Kodi 19 (Matrix).

If your transmission daemon is running on a machine other than localhost, using a port other than 9091, or requires authentication, you will have to change the plugin settings before running it.
